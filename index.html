        That feeling of weakness and discomfort when you have not had food in
        your stomach has to be one of the worst feelings ever. All you can dream
        about is getting SOME food in your stomach. If you have not experienced
        that discomfort, you are one of the lucky few. How many people are
        hungry in the world? Globally, about 8.9% of the world's population —
        690 million people — go to bed on an empty stomach each night. Since
        2014, the number of people affected by hunger has been slowly on the
        rise. If it continues at this rate, it'll exceed 840 million by 2030.
        With COVID-19 on the rise, Estimates suggest that an additional 83
        million to 132 million more people will be chronically hungry due to the
        pandemic. According to Action Against Hunger, there is more than enough
        food produced in the world to feed everyone on the planet. Let's beat
        those numbers.
      </p>
      <p class="h7 text-center font-weight-bold">How will we achieve this?</p>
      <p>
        charitAble is a non-profit organization dedicated to combatting that
        hunger in various areas of the world. We travel to different areas on
        our own expense and work with those surrounding to put meals on the
        table for families. We give these donations directly to the family/
        individual based off of the calculated amount needed. It is our hope to
        bring that smile that you feel when taking your first bite of a meal to
        those in need.

        Right now, the Sub-Saharan Africa is still the region with the highest
        prevalence of undernourishment, estimated at 22% of the population. We
        have sent out a team of 45 volunteers to help out. As of December 4,
        2020, they have filled 321 stomachs. Each day progresses this number.

    <p>
      Small farmers, herders, and fishermen produce about 70 percent of the
      global food supply, yet they are especially vulnerable to food insecurity
      – poverty and hunger are most acute among rural populations. Tens of
      thousands of farmers have peacefully swarmed India's capital where they
      intend to camp out for weeks to protest new agricultural laws that they
      say could destroy their livelihoods. The new rules will leave them worse
      off by making it easier for corporates to exploit agricultural workers who
      make up more than half of India's 480 million-strong workforce, according
      to India's most recent Census in 2011. While they camp out and stand their
      ground, a team of 50 have volunteered to help feed these protesters.
